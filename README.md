# agentflow
AgentFlow is a DSL for AI agents democratizing non-developer tool, workflow and UI creation in the spirit of tools like Excel Macros, Tableau, and Zapier.

AI agents running everything. Code running across companies handling various tasks: answering customer service requests, reading documents, completing applications, completing work and projects that weren't possible to get done before.

- Is Python the only way? Will it scale and be maintainable for the vision of scores of agents helping with work?
- How do non-developers contribute? analysts, project managers, power users, quality assurance people, SME's
- Contributions to prompts, instructions and evals? These are the new operating procedures and knowledge assets of a company. These assets will move out of code just like views/frontend separated from PHP style single file spaghetti when MVC/RoR conventions took off. 
- LLM, AI and agents shouldn't just be API calls, python scripts, code without conventions, and the latest framework
- People need to think in terms of: intents, goals, workflow, metrics, memory, context, evals and HTIL knowledge extraction for model/context/RAG improvement alongside energy/compute efficiency.
